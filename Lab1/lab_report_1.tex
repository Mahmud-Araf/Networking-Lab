\section{Theory}
A Local Area Network or simply LAN constitutes a network of 
interconnected devices within a limited geographic region,facilitating communication via either wired or wireless connections. 
This network encompasses computers, servers, 
printers, and other devices, all of which necessitate systematic configuration for optimal functionality.
The LAN infrastructure involves essential components such as routers, switches, and access points. Individual device settings, including IP addresses, subnet masks, and default gateways, 
are configured to establish seamless communication.Integral to the LAN setup and troubleshooting process is 
the utilization of terminal commands that empower administrators to diagnose and resolve connectivity issues.
The following commands play a crucial role in this endeavor:

\vspace{\baselineskip}
\textbf{ping:} \\
\texttt{ping} is employed to assess the reachability of a target device within the network. It sends packets to the target and reports the round-trip time, aiding in identifying potential communication problems.

\vspace{\baselineskip}
\vspace{\baselineskip}

\textbf{traceroute:} \\
\texttt{traceroute} reveals the path taken by data packets between the source and destination devices. It helps identify potential bottlenecks or issues along the route.

\textbf{ifconfig:} \\
\texttt{ifconfig} provides information about the network interfaces of a device, allowing administrators to review and configure settings such as IP addresses, subnet masks, and interface status.

\textbf{arp and rarp:} \\
\texttt{arp} resolves IP addresses to MAC addresses, while \texttt{rarp} performs the reverse, resolving MAC addresses to IP addresses. These commands are valuable for addressing issues related to address resolution.

\textbf{nslookup:} \\
\texttt{nslookup} is employed to query DNS servers for information about domain names and IP addresses, aiding in the resolution of domain-related issues.

\textbf{netstat:} \\
\texttt{netstat} provides a snapshot of a device's network connections, routing tables, and interface statistics. This command is instrumental in identifying active connections and potential issues affecting network performance.
\vspace{\baselineskip}

In summary, the LAN setup and troubleshooting tools aims to showcase proficiency in employing these terminal commands. The documentation should articulate the methodologies applied, highlight the results obtained through these commands, and provide a comprehensive overview of the troubleshooting process.

\section{Methodology}

\subsection{PING}
\textbf{ping:} \\
The \texttt{ping} command is a fundamental network diagnostic tool used to assess the reachability and responsiveness of a target device within a network. It operates by sending a series of small data packets, known as "echo requests," to the target device and measuring the time it takes for the device to send back corresponding "echo replies."
\vspace{\baselineskip}
\vspace{\baselineskip}
\vspace{\baselineskip}
\vspace{\baselineskip}

\textbf{Syntax:}
\texttt{ping [options] destination}
\vspace{\baselineskip}

\textbf{Usage:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{ping example.com} - Sends ICMP echo requests to the specified domain or IP address.
    \item \texttt{ping -c 4 example.com} - Sends only 4 packets for the test.
\end{itemize}

\vspace{\baselineskip}

\textbf{Functionality:}

1. \textbf{Assessing Reachability:} \texttt{ping} helps verify whether a target device is reachable over the network. A successful ping indicates that the target device is responsive and can be reached.

2. \textbf{Round-Trip Time (RTT):} \texttt{ping} measures the Round-Trip Time (RTT), which is the time taken for an echo request to travel from the source device to the target device and back. This provides insights into the latency or delay in the network.

3. \textbf{Packet Loss:} \texttt{ping} also reports on packet loss, indicating the percentage of sent packets that did not receive a reply. High packet loss can signify network congestion or connectivity issues.

\vspace{\baselineskip}

\textbf{Options:} \\
\texttt{-c count:} Specifies the number of echo requests to send.\\
\texttt{-i interval:} Sets the time interval between sending echo requests.\\
\texttt{-s packetsize:} Defines the size of the data packets to send.\\
\texttt{-t timeout:} Sets the maximum time to wait for an echo reply.\\

\textbf{Use Cases:} \\
1. \textbf{Basic Connectivity Check:} \texttt{ping} is commonly used to verify the basic connectivity between devices, such as checking if a computer can communicate with a server.

2. \textbf{Troubleshooting Network Issues:} When experiencing network connectivity problems, administrators often use \texttt{ping} to diagnose issues such as high latency, packet loss, or unresponsive devices.

3. \textbf{Monitoring Network Stability:} System administrators use \texttt{ping} in network monitoring tools to continuously assess the stability and performance of network connections over time.


\subsection{TRACEROUTE}
\textbf{traceroute:} \\
The \texttt{traceroute} command is a network diagnostic tool used to visualize and analyze the route that data packets take from the source device to a target destination across a network. It helps identify the intermediary devices (routers) along the path and measure the time it takes for packets to traverse each hop.

\vspace{\baselineskip}

\textbf{Syntax:}

    \item \texttt{traceroute -m 20 example.com} - Limits the maximum number of hops to 20.
\end{itemize}

\vspace{\baselineskip}

\textbf{Functionality:}

1. \textbf{Visualizing Network Route:} \texttt{traceroute} displays a list of routers (hops) through which data packets traverse from the source to the destination. It helps identify the path taken by packets across the network.

2. \textbf{Measuring Hop Delays:} The tool measures the time it takes for an individual packet to travel from the source to each intermediary router, providing insights into the latency at each hop.

\vspace{\baselineskip}

\textbf{Options:} \\
\texttt{-m max\_hops:} Specifies the maximum number of hops to search for the target.\\
\texttt{-n:} Skips DNS resolution for faster results.\\
\texttt{-w waittime:} Defines the maximum time to wait for a response at each hop.

\vspace{\baselineskip}

\textbf{Use Cases:}\\
1. \textbf{Network Path Analysis:} \texttt{traceroute} is used to analyze the path taken by data packets, providing a visual representation of network routes.\\
2. \textbf{Diagnosing Latency Issues:} Network administrators utilize \texttt{traceroute} to identify and troubleshoot latency problems at specific hops along the route.\\
